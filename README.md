# Godot Tutorial

This is the repository of a simple game, which is built upon the [tutorial by Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0).

This project has the following additional features (in order of completion):
* "You Died" text when the player dies
* Health: The player starts with 100 HP, and can be damaged a variable amount (e.g. 20 by enemies, 100 by falling off the map).
* Coyote Time: The player can jump, even if they are a *little* too late.
* Main Menu: A simple "Play" and "Quit" main menu with the first level as a backdrop.
* Scaling: The game scales with the window size, rather than showing more of the game, when the window is bigger.
* UI: A very simple UI consisting of the health (implemented with the health) as well as the current number of coins gathered.
